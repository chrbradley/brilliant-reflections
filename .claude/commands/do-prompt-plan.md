1. Open **@planning/prompt_plan.md** and identify any prompts not marked as completed.
2. For each incomplete prompt:
    - Double-check if it's truly unfinished (if uncertain, ask for clarification).
    - If you confirm it's already done, skip it.
    - Otherwise, implement it as described.
    - Make sure the tests pass, and the program builds/runs
    - run linting on the changed files
    - run code formatting on the changed files
3. After you finish each prompt, pause and wait for user review or feedback:
    - summarize changes made
    - run the app and provide manual testing instructions if applicable
    - ask the user to confirm application is building and working as expected
    - if they confirm, continue
4. After user confirms application is functioning as expected.
    - Update **@planning/prompt_plan.md** to mark this prompt as completed.
    - Update **@planning/todo.md** to mark the associated todos as complete.
    - Commit the changes to your repository with a clear commit message.
      - never include generated by or co-authored claude code or anthropic
      - the commit message should not include the line  "ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)"
      - the commit message should not include the line "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
5. Repeat with the next unfinished prompt as directed by the user.

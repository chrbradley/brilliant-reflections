## Current Status

**Next Step**: Step 1 - Project Foundation

**Notes**: 
- Each step follows functional programming principles
- No classes - use pure functions and composition
- Immutable state management throughout
- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Commit after each completed step
- Update this file as steps are completed

## Key Principles

1. **Functional Programming**
   - Pure functions wherever possible
   - Immutable data structures
   - Function composition over inheritance
   - Declarative over imperative

2. **State Management**
   - Redux-like patterns
   - Pure reducers
   - Selector functions
   - Effect isolation

3. **Testing**
   - Test pure functions extensively
   - Mock side effects
   - Property-based testing where applicable

## Testing Checklist

For each step, ensure:
- [ ] Unit tests for pure functions
- [ ] Integration tests for composed functions
- [ ] No TypeScript errors (strict mode)
- [ ] ESLint/Prettier compliance
- [ ] Functional programming principles followed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Committed to version control

## Dependencies

- Vite
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Babylon.js
- ESLint (with functional rules)
- Prettier
- Vitest (for testing)

## Architecture Notes

- **No Classes**: Use functions and function composition
- **Immutability**: All data structures are immutable
- **Pure Functions**: Business logic in pure functions
- **Effect Isolation**: Side effects clearly separated
- **Functional Composition**: Build complex behavior from simple functions

## Deployment

- Vercel deployment
- GitHub repository
- Automated builds via Vite

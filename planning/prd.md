# Mirror Room Reflection Interactive - Product Requirements Document

This document provides comprehensive product requirements for the Mirror Room Reflection Interactive, a browser-based educational tool designed to teach geometric reasoning through interactive mirror reflections. The PRD serves as the authoritative guide for development, outlining all features, technical requirements, and user interactions necessary to deliver a successful proof-of-concept.

## 1. Introduction

The Mirror Room Reflection Interactive is an innovative educational web application that leverages real-time 3D visualization to help learners understand geometric concepts through mirror reflections. By providing an interactive environment where users can manipulate objects and observe ray reflections in both 2D editor and 3D render views, the application creates an engaging learning experience that bridges abstract mathematical concepts with visual understanding.

This PRD defines the complete scope, features, and technical specifications required to develop the proof-of-concept, ensuring alignment between stakeholders, designers, and developers throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. Product overview

The Mirror Room Reflection Interactive is a single-page web application that presents learners with a dual-canvas interface. The left canvas provides a top-down orthographic editor view where users can manipulate a colored cube and camera position within a three-walled mirror room. The right canvas displays a real-time perspective render showing how light rays reflect off the mirrors based on user-defined parameters.

Key capabilities include:
- Interactive manipulation of 3D objects with precise snap controls
- Visualization of omni-directional light rays with configurable reflection bounces
- Real-time rendering that accurately represents mirror reflections

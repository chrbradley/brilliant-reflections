# Render View Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This plan enhances the existing render view in the Brilliant Reflections application. The codebase already has cube geometry, room creation, camera systems, and basic mirror textures. This plan focuses on adding multi-bounce reflections and improving the render view to match the specification while reusing existing components.

## Existing Components to Leverage
- **Cube**: `createCube()` with correct colored faces
- **Room**: `createRoom()`, `createWall()`, `createFloor()`, `createCeiling()`
- **Camera**: `createPerspectiveCamera()`, `syncCameraWithIndicator()`
- **Mirrors**: `createMirrorConfig()`, `applyMirrorToWall()`
- **Scenes**: `createRenderScene()`, `createEditorScene()`

## Phase 1: Render View Optimization

### Step 1: Layer Mask Implementation
Add layer masking to existing render scene to hide editor-only objects.

### Step 2: Camera Sync Verification
Ensure the existing camera sync properly excludes camera indicator from render.

### Step 3: Material System Audit
Verify existing materials match spec (reflective walls, emissive ceiling, matte floor).

### Step 4: Reflection System Baseline
Test and document current single-bounce reflection behavior.

## Phase 2: Multi-Bounce Foundation

### Step 5: Render Pass Architecture
Create a multi-pass rendering system using existing mirror textures.

### Step 6: Second Bounce Implementation
Add second reflection pass to show reflections in reflections.

### Step 7: Dynamic Bounce Count
Make bounce count configurable from existing UI controls.

### Step 8: Render Order Optimization
Optimize render order for performance with multiple passes.

## Phase 3: Performance and Quality

### Step 9: Reflection Texture Quality
Connect existing quality dropdown to mirror texture resolution.

### Step 10: Performance Monitoring
Add FPS counter and performance metrics to render view.

### Step 11: Selective Rendering
Optimize which objects are included in each reflection pass.

## Phase 4: UI Integration

### Step 12: Bounce Count Control
Wire existing bounce count UI to render system.

### Step 13: Quality Setting Control
Wire existing quality dropdown to reflection textures.

### Step 14: State Persistence
Ensure settings persist through scene updates.

## Phase 5: Edge Cases and Polish

### Step 15: Camera Boundary Handling
Handle edge cases when camera is very close to walls.

### Step 16: Dynamic Object Updates
Ensure reflections update when cube moves.

### Step 17: Memory Management
Properly dispose old textures when quality changes.

## Phase 6: Final Integration

### Step 18: Complete System Test
Verify all components work together correctly.

### Step 19: Performance Optimization
Optimize for 30+ FPS target.

### Step 20: Documentation
Document the render system for future development.

## Detailed Implementation Prompts

### Prompt 1: Layer Mask Implementation

```text
Enhance the existing render view to use Babylon.js layer masks to hide editor-only objects.

Context:
- The render scene already exists in src/render/createRenderScene.ts
- Editor objects like camera indicator and ground plane need to be hidden
- The camera indicator is created in src/editor/createCameraIndicator.ts

Requirements:
- Define layer constants (RENDER_LAYER = 0x01, EDITOR_LAYER = 0x02)
- Modify createRenderScene to set camera.layerMask = RENDER_LAYER
- Add utility function to mark meshes as editor-only
- Apply to camera indicator and editor ground plane

Tests should verify:
- Render camera only shows RENDER_LAYER objects
- Camera indicator is not visible in render view
- Cube and room geometry remain visible
- Layer assignment persists through updates

Integrate with existing code - don't recreate the scene.
```

### Prompt 2: Camera Sync Verification

```text
Verify and enhance the existing camera synchronization to ensure camera indicator is excluded.

Context:
- Camera sync exists in src/render/syncCameraWithIndicator.ts
- Camera indicator exists in src/editor/createCameraIndicator.ts
- Both scenes share the same camera indicator object

Requirements:
- Review syncCameraWithIndicator implementation
- Ensure camera indicator mesh has EDITOR_LAYER assigned
- Verify render camera transform matches indicator transform
- Confirm indicator is not visible in render view

Tests should verify:
- Camera position syncs correctly

## Testing Strategy

Each prompt should follow TDD principles while integrating with existing code:
1. Write tests for new functionality
2. Enhance existing components rather than replacing
3. Ensure backward compatibility
4. Test integration points thoroughly

## Key Integration Points
